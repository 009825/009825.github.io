They warn the ones who rush ahead,
Who pry through doors not meant to tread.
For paths revealed before their time
Will turn to dust, will lose their rhyme.

They watch the curious cheat the thread,
Who search the maker’s vault instead.
The hidden forge, the builder’s den—
Those halls were never made for them.

Only the story’s proper way
Will keep the truth from turning gray.
Follow the order, step by trace,
Let every clue fall into place.

For those who force the locks to see…
They break the tale it’s meant to be.
